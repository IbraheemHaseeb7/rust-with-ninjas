# Rust With Tech Ninjas

The Objective of Ninjas are as follow:

- Create your folder with your `registration number`
- Go to [playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2021) to run or play with `Rust`
- Grab a simple task like printing your name, finding the primitive data types, explore rust a little.
- Perform that task and create a `README.md` file (explore internet for how to create README files) and explain all the difficulties you faced as compared to normal programming languages.
- Feel free to add your `Rust` code in the `README` file
- Create a pull request and that's it.

```
NOTE: If you face any difficulties or don't understand the task feel free to ask in the Whatsapp Group
```

Good Luck and don't disappoint me ðŸŒš
